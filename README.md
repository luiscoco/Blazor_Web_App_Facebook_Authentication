There is a new way to create apps with Meta
Instead of picking and choosing an option from a list of permissions and products, we create customizable use cases.
Explore use cases
Use cases are made up of the combinations of permissions, roles, and products that developers most frequently use to add integrations and functionality to apps.
Are you looking for something else?
There are a limited number of use cases available right now, but we will add more in the future.
To create an app with something that is not included in our use cases, select "Other" and choose the app type.

8. What commercial portfolio do you want to connect to this app?
Connect a verified business portfolio to your app to access business and third-party user data from other business portfolios and publish this app. You can connect an unverified business portfolio or add one later, but you will need to complete verification to access the data.

9. We select the second use case: Facebook Login Use Case

https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/facebook-login-use-case/

Authenticate and prompt users with Facebook login. Our most common use case. 

A secure and fast way for users to sign in to your app or game and have the app ask them for permissions to access their data to personalize their experience. Learn more.
